# Robotic Process Automation---Candidate Routine Checker
Implmentations of simple mechanisms for checking candidate routines in a given trace of executed activities
Project based on COMP10002 2020 Semester 2 Assignment 2 

## Stage 0 - Reading and Analayzing Input Data
raed input data from stdin, ensure that the input trace is valid, and print out some basic information 
- number of distinct actions
- length of the input trace
- trace status
and the state of boolean variables after each valid action
